1. First rinse 1 cup white chickpeas a couple of times in water. Then soak them in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.

2. Next day they will double in size.

3. Then drain the water.

4. In a 3 litre pressure cooker add the chickpeas. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. I have used a pressure cooker but you can also use a pot or pan. The chickpeas will take a lesser time to cook in the pressure cooker than cooking them in a pot. You can also add a pinch or two of baking soda while cooking them. Addition of baking soda is optional.

5. Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes or till they are tender and cooked well. Once the pressure settles down on its own then open the lid of pressure cooker and check if the chickpeas are cooked well or not. It is important to cook them till they are soft and have a melt in the mouth texture.If cooking them in a pan then it can take about an hour or more. Just ensure they are well cooked. Timing to cook chickpeas will depend upon their quality and age.

6. Once done then drain all the water and keep the cooked chickpeas aside.

7.  chop 1 medium-sized onion, 2 medium-sized tomatoes, 1 green chili, 4 to 5 medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 inch ginger.Prepped up ingredients in white bowls - chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, garlic and ginger
8. Add them to a blender jar.Added onions, tomatoes, green chillies, ginger, garlic in a blender

9. Make a fine paste in a grinder or blender. No need to add water while making the paste as the juice of the tomatoes will help in making the paste keep the jar aside blended to a fine paste

11. Measure and keep all the ingredients ready for making the gravy spices and other ingredients kept in individual white bowls. 

12. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a pan or kadai/wok.

13. Add the following whole garam masala (spices) – 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 large tej patta (Indian bay leaf), 2 inch cinnamon, 2 to 3 cloves, 2 green cardamoms and 2 to 3 black peppercorns add whole spices in hot oil. 

14. Fry the whole spices till they are fragrant but don’t burn them.

15. Next add the ground masala paste add the ground onion, tomato, green chilli, ginger, garlic paste

16. Mix well.

17. Keep stirring often. Sauté for 8 to 10 minutes or more till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste. The paste will also thicken and become glossy. 

18. Stir while sautéing so that the paste does not stick to the pan.

19. Then add all the dry spice powders – ½ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) and ½ or 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder).

20. Mix the spice powders very well and sauté for a minute or two.

21. Then add the cooked chickpeas.

22. Mix well.

23. Pour 1 to 1.5 cups water or add as required. Addition of water depends upon the consistency you want. But don’t add too much water as then the flavors will get diluted.

24. Add salt as required and stir again.

25. Simmer the gravy on a low to medium flame for 12 to 15 minutes or till the gravy thickens.

26. Don’t cover the pan. Stir occasionally. Mash some chickpeas with the back of a spoon. This helps in thickening the gravy.

27. Add 1 slit green chili and 1 teaspoon garam masala powder or chole masala powder slit green chillies and garam masala powder added to the gravy

28. Stir and simmer the gravy for a minute or two. You can keep the consistency from medium to slightly thick to semi dry or dry. If you want a dry consistency then simmer for some more time.

29. Check the seasoning and add more salt or spice powders if required. Garnish with coriander leaves. You can also garnish with some slit green chilies and ginger julienne
chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) added.

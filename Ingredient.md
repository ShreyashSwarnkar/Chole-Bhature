Ingredients required

1.5 cups all-purpose flour (maida)
⅓ cup sooji (rava or fine semolina)
½ tablespoon oil or ghee
½ tablespoon granulated fine sugar
½ teaspoon salt or as required
¼ or ½ teaspoon baking soda
½ cup curd (yogurt)

4. Cover the dough with a wet cotton napkin and keep aside for 2 hours.

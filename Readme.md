Chole Bhature also known as Chana Bhatura is one of the most popular Punjabi dish liked almost all over India. Chole stands for a spiced tangy chickpea curry and Bhatura is a soft and fluffy fried leavened bread.

Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry. In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.

This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chickpea curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a homely taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.

Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and dense.

The delicious chickpea curry can be also had with poori, Naan or Kulcha or Aloo Kulcha or aloo paratha. They taste equally good with bread or pav (dinner rolls).

The chickpeas have to be cooked really well. They should not be just cooked or aldente, the way they are served in many restaurants. They should be soft when cooked and melt in your mouth. However, care should be taken that they should not be overcooked or become mushy.

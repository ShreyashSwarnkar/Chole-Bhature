Chole Bhature also known as Chana Bhatura is one of the most popular Punjabi dish liked almost all over India. Chole stands for a spiced tangy chickpea curry and Bhatura is a soft and fluffy fried leavened bread.

Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry. In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.

This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chickpea curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a homely taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.

Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and dense.

The delicious chickpea curry can be also had with poori, Naan or Kulcha or Aloo Kulcha or aloo paratha. They taste equally good with bread or pav (dinner rolls).

The chickpeas have to be cooked really well. They should not be just cooked or aldente, the way they are served in many restaurants. They should be soft when cooked and melt in your mouth. However, care should be taken that they should not be overcooked or become mushy.

First rinse 1 cup white chickpeas a couple of times in water. Then soak them in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.

Next day they will double in size.

Then drain the water.

In a 3 litre pressure cooker add the chickpeas. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. I have used a pressure cooker but you can also use a pot or pan. The chickpeas will take a lesser time to cook in the pressure cooker than cooking them in a pot. You can also add a pinch or two of baking soda while cooking them. Addition of baking soda is optional.

Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes or till they are tender and cooked well. Once the pressure settles down on its own then open the lid of pressure cooker and check if the chickpeas are cooked well or not. It is important to cook them till they are soft and have a melt in the mouth texture.If cooking them in a pan then it can take about an hour or more. Just ensure they are well cooked. Timing to cook chickpeas will depend upon their quality and age.

Once done then drain all the water and keep the cooked chickpeas aside.

chop 1 medium-sized onion, 2 medium-sized tomatoes, 1 green chili, 4 to 5 medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 inch ginger.Prepped up ingredients in white bowls - chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, garlic and ginger

Add them to a blender jar.Added onions, tomatoes, green chillies, ginger, garlic in a blender

Make a fine paste in a grinder or blender. No need to add water while making the paste as the juice of the tomatoes will help in making the paste keep the jar aside blended to a fine paste

Measure and keep all the ingredients ready for making the gravy spices and other ingredients kept in individual white bowls.

Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a pan or kadai/wok.

Add the following whole garam masala (spices) – 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 large tej patta (Indian bay leaf), 2 inch cinnamon, 2 to 3 cloves, 2 green cardamoms and 2 to 3 black peppercorns add whole spices in hot oil.

Fry the whole spices till they are fragrant but don’t burn them.

Next add the ground masala paste add the ground onion, tomato, green chilli, ginger, garlic paste

Mix well.

Keep stirring often. Sauté for 8 to 10 minutes or more till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste. The paste will also thicken and become glossy.

Stir while sautéing so that the paste does not stick to the pan.

Then add all the dry spice powders – ½ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, 1 pinch asafoetida (hing) and ½ or 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder).

Mix the spice powders very well and sauté for a minute or two.

Then add the cooked chickpeas.

Mix well.

Pour 1 to 1.5 cups water or add as required. Addition of water depends upon the consistency you want. But don’t add too much water as then the flavors will get diluted.

Add salt as required and stir again.

Simmer the gravy on a low to medium flame for 12 to 15 minutes or till the gravy thickens.

Don’t cover the pan. Stir occasionally. Mash some chickpeas with the back of a spoon. This helps in thickening the gravy.

Add 1 slit green chili and 1 teaspoon garam masala powder or chole masala powder slit green chillies and garam masala powder added to the gravy

Stir and simmer the gravy for a minute or two. You can keep the consistency from medium to slightly thick to semi dry or dry. If you want a dry consistency then simmer for some more time.

Check the seasoning and add more salt or spice powders if required. Garnish with coriander leaves. You can also garnish with some slit green chilies and ginger julienne chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) added.

Serve chickpea curry with onion slices, lemon wedges along with bhatura. Enjoy the curry with bhatura. You can also serve this delicious curry with naan or aloo paratha or plain paratha or kulcha or tandoori roti.
